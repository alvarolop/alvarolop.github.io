![About me](featured-image.jpg "About me")


Hi there!!

I'm an enthusiastic engineer with a great combination of technical skills and a customer-centric approach. With a telecom background and international experience, **I'm currently supporting customers with their open source software technologies at Red Hat Iberia**.

I'm focused on the Red Hat middleware and application development portfolio: **In-memory fast caches, CI/CD, application containerization, Openshift, Kubernetes, GitOps, and Service Mesh**. I'm also using Ansible in my daily work.

For almost four years, I've been **guiding the adoption of Red Hat's solutions** in companies from diverse industries such as retail, banking, and insurance. Also, delivering **training materials and workshops** to support customers in their transformation process to Kubernetes and Caches. Currently onboarding and mentoring a team of Red Hat Data Grid consultants that will participate in projects in the EMEA region.
